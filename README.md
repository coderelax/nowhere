### Deployment

You can deploy this website using GitHub Pages:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   - Ensure all your website files (including `index.html`) are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/coderelax/nowhere).
   - Click on the **Settings** tab.
   - In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Select the root (`/`) folder as the source (unless your site is in a subfolder).
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Access your site**
   - After a few moments, your site will be available at:
     ```
     https://coderelax.github.io/nowhere/
     ```
   - GitHub will display the published URL in the Pages settings.

4. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - If you want to use a custom domain, add your domain in the Pages settings and create a `CNAME` file in your repo with your domain name.
